# Analytical_Min_Size
Codes relating the minimum size to the filter and projection parameters of the robust formulation.

You will find the 2 MATLAB codes related to the article :

["Analytical relationships for imposing minimum length scale inthe robust topology optimization formulation."](10.1007/s00158-021-02998-w)

Trillet D., Duysinx P., Fernandez E.

SizeSolution.m implements the theoretical relations developped in the article and provides a set of parameters to impose user-defined sizes in both the solid and void phases.

MinLengthScales_Analytical_and_Numerical.m allows to have the numerical implementation for a given filter radius and it plots the curves proposed in the article.
